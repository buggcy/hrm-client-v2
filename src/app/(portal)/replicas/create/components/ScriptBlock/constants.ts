  "<span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;Keep lips closed and look into the camera for 1 second&gt;</span><br/><br/>Hey there, Tavus! I, {{Full Name}}, am currently speaking and give consent Tavus to create an AI clone of me by using the audio and video samples I provide. I understand that this AI clone can be used to create videos that look and sound like me.<br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>Alrighty, let's dive into the training script. Get your energy up! How you speak in this recording, is how your replica will sound.\nSo, don't forget to flash that smile and speak at a comfortable, regular pace. No need to rush through it!<br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>We're pretty excited that you're creating your very own replica. Once you've got one, you can make videos of yourself super easily. With just a script. \nYou can add a personal touch to thousands of videos, without recording them all. <br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>Just checking, if you’re still smiling?\nNow, if you don't mind, we need you to say some goofy sentences. This’ll help us fine-tune your replica. And don't sweat it if you stumble a bit – just keep the ball rolling.<br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>Here's the first one:\nThat speedy beige fox leaped into the sky over each slender pup. Watch out, I yell, 'cause he's outfoxed you again, stirring up some major mayhem. <br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>Ready for the next one? Don’t overthink it, and keep smiling!\nThe ravenous purple dino chomped down on the friendly, zesty fox, the chattering crab, and the crazy whale, then went on a vending and quacking spree. <br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>Alright, let's take a breather and chat business.\nYou’re probably pretty excited about using video. And so are we. We think Tavus is the future of personalized customer engagement at scale. You can send a custom video to thousands of customers using email, SMS, or in-product. \nNow that’s something to smile about!<br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>You might be a real estate agent or recruiter using email to reach out to a ton of clients. And now, you can now add a personalized video to the mix.<br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>Maybe you’re responsible for product growth at a software or ecommerce company. You can now whip up personalized onboarding tutorials in-product or send new users a personal welcome message from your CEO.<br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>But before you let your creativity run wild, we need one more whimsical sentence – if that's cool with you. <br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>Here goes:\nThe shade on the waters of the lake left everyone, even the fancy French queen, in awe, right before she caught wind of that symphony once more.<br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>We're almost there! \nThanks a million for recording your training video. Now, it's time to work magic on your footage and manifest your replica. Within a mere 24 hours, your replica will be ready to rock, and you'll be all set to whip up videos with nothing but a script. Super exciting!<br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/>Thanks a bunch for choosing Tavus. We're thrilled to have you on board!<br/><span class='text-muted-foreground'>&lt;close your lips&gt;</span><br/> ";
